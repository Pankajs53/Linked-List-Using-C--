Linked List Implementations in C++

This repository contains C++ implementations of various linked list types, including singular (singly) linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular doubly linked lists. Linked lists are fundamental data structures used in computer science for efficient data storage and manipulation.

Implemented Features:
1.Singly Linked List:
  Insertion at the head of the list.
  Insertion at the tail of the list.
  Insertion at a specific position in the list.
  Deletion from a specific position in the list.

2.Doubly Linked List:
  Insertion at the head of the list.
  Insertion at the tail of the list.
  Insertion at a specific position in the list.
  Insertion after a specific data value in the list.
  Deletion from a specific position in the list.
3.Circular Doubly Linked List:
  Insertion at the head of the list.
  Insertion at the tail of the list.
  Insertion at a specific position in the list.
  Insertion after a specific data value in the list.
  Deletion from a specific position in the list.

Usage:
  Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
  Compile the C++ file: g++ main.cpp -o main
  Run the executable: ./main

Feel free to use and modify these implementations in your C++ projects. Contributions are welcome!

** Will be adding Implementation of Singly Circular Linked List Soon **
